# COVID-19-situation-dashboard
### Project Objective
Creating a COVID-19 Dashboard to provide an overview of the situation of this pandemic by the end of 2023, in which I analyze COVID by 3 dimensions: Infection, Death and Vaccination
### Data Source
The data used in this project is retrieved from 2 sources:
- Dataset provided by Our world in data [owid Covid data](https://catalog.ourworldindata.org/garden/covid/latest/compact/compact.csv)
- Web scraping directly from [WHO COVID-19](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/cases)
### Findings
- COVID-19 were infected globally in 2020, the infection trend continued and peaked in 2022
- Its fatality was the most serious in 2020 and 2021; in 2022, despite the wide spread, fatality rate was at the lowest thanks to vaccination efforts
- In 2023, COVID-19 was still present yet low infection rate and fatality rate suggest that it is no longer a pandemic with high threats
